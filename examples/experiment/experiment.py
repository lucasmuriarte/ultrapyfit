if __name__ == '__main__':

	path = os.path.join(
		get_root_directory(),
		'examples', 'data', 'denoised_2.csv')

	experiment = Experiment.load_data(path, wave_is_row=True)

	# alternatively experiment can be instantiated as follows

	# from ultrafast.utils.divers import read_data, select_traces
	# time, data, wave = read_data(path, wave_is_row= True)
	# experiment = Experiment(time, data, wave)

	# DATA EXPLORATION
	# ----------------
	# The first thing to do is explore the data set loaded

	# To explore the spectral dimension use "plot_spectra" method
	# By default all spectra will be plotted 
	# (Except if there are more than 250 which is the case here)
	experiment.plot_spectra('auto')
	plt.show()
	# You might need to run plt.show() from here

	# From the figure we observe that 8 spectra equally spaced
	# at 1520 nm are displayed.

	# To plot plot a different number of traces automatically use the following format
	# ['auto', 6, 1480] six spectra plotted equally spced at 1480
	experiment.plot_spectra(times=['auto', 6, 1480])

	# To explore the time dimension use "plot_traces" method
	# This function plots by default the selected traces except 
	# If traces is set to 'auto' 10 traces separated equally in spectra dimension
	# are display
	experiment.plot_traces()

	# alternatively we can pass a list of traces value (according to wave vector)
	experiment.plot_traces([1408,1520,1578])

	# To explore the number of components is possible to use the singular value decomposition (SVD)
	# The SVD reveal that the data set is compose by three components
	experiment.plotSVD(1, True)

	# After selecting the SV this can be plot again with "plot_traces" function
	experiment.plot_traces()

	# The original traces can be selected again with "select_traces" method
	experiment.select_traces(points='all')

	# To perform a global fit normally is not perform over the complete data set
	# but over a selection of traces. Selecting traces is easy with "select_traces"
	# function. To select a series of traces indicate the separation value.
	# The selected traces will be separated 10 points in the wave vector
	experiment.select_traces(points=10, average=0)

	# UNITS
	# -----
	# Experiment automatically handles unit of figures via two attributes
	# Modifying the units automatically modify figures axis and legends
	# time_unit by default "ps"
	# wavelength_unit by default "nm"
	experiment.time_unit 
	# >>> 'ps'
	experiment.time_unit = 'us'
	experiment.time_unit 
	# >>> 'Î¼s'
	experiment.time_unit = 'millisecond'
	experiment.time_unit 
	# >>> 'ms'

	experiment.wave_unit 
	# >>> 'nm'
	experiment.wave_unit = 'wavenumber'
	experiment.wave_unit 
	# >>> 'cm-1'
	experiment.wave_unit = 'nanometer'
	experiment.wave_unit 
	# >>> 'nm'
	experiment.wave_unit = 'cm'
	experiment.wave_unit 
	# >>> 'cm-1'

	# DATA FITTING
	# ------------
	# The first step to perform a fitting is to initialize the model and the parameters.
	# For a classical exponential fitting use "initial_exp_params" function.
	# the first parameters to indicate is t0 and fwhm which indicates if the exponential
	# fit is modified with a gaussian function. For this data set t0 = 0, and fwhm = None
	# Since we dont have the signal raising. Then the initial guess for the fit are given.
	# The SVD reveled that 3 component where needed, and values are given after plotting 
	# several traces.
	#                               (t0, fwhm, t1, t2, t3)
	experiment.initialize_exp_params(0, None, 4, 60, 500)

	# now we are ready to fit the data with "final_fit" method, this will previously
	# run a prefit 
	experiment.global_fit()

	# RESULTS EXPLORING
	# -----------------
	# For any fit the first thing is to print the results which can be done with the
	# "print_results" method (If none fit number is passed the last performed fit
	# will be consider)
	experiment.print_results()

	# >>> Fit number 1: 	Global Exponential fit
	# >>> -------------------------------------------------
	# >>> Results:	Parameter		Initial value	Final value		Vary
	# >>>			time 0:   		0.0000   		0.0000   		False
	# >>>			tau 1:   		4.0000   		8.0000   		True
	# >>>			tau 2:   		60.0000   		30.0000   		True
	# >>>			tau 3:   		500.0000   		200.0000   		True
	# >>> Details:
	# >>> 		Number of traces: 30; average: 0
	# >>> 		Fit with 3 exponential; Deconvolution False
	# >>> 		Tau inf: None
	# >>> 		Number of iterations: 994
	# >>> 		Number of parameters optimized: 240
	# >>> 		Weights: False

	# The following step is plot the fit and residual plot which is done with the 
	# "plot_fit" method
	experiment.plot_fit()

	# finally the Decay Associated Spectra (DAS) can be plotted with the plot_DAS method
	experiment.plot_DAS()
